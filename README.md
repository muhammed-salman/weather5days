# A simple current 5 day weather forecasting App

## Instruction for running app on localhost

1. Open your terminal and clone the app using command `git clone https://github.com/muhammed-salman/weather5days.git`
2. Type `cd weather5days` to get inside the directory.
3. Now type `npm install`
4. After the installation of required node_modules type `npm run start`
5. Now the application can be accessed on `localhost:3050`

## Following scripts are available in the project

### usage: `npm run <script_name>`

1. `start`: To run project on localhost:3050
2. `test`: To test the App using mocha
3. `test:watch`: To continously run the test while modifying files.
4. `clean`: To remove the production build code
5. `build`: To create a production build for deployment
6. `serve`: To run webpack development server
7. `deploy`: To deploy the App to github pages

## What can be done with more time
- App can be made responsive
- Detailed test cases can be written
- UX can be improved
- Weather forecasting can be displayed for mutiple days and more information can be displayed
- I think some sort of analytics can also be done
** I'will update if I get more ideas **
